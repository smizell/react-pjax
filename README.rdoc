This is a proof of concept of an idea where I use HTML as the content type (instead of JSON) and pjax for routing.
This provides several key benefits.

1. API is browseable since it's HTML
2. API HTML is separate from UI HTML
3. API is useable with <noscript>
4. Entire API could change completely from a URL structure perspective and app would still work
5. No need to manage separate JSON API
6. Developers manage HTML representations, Designers represent UI HTML
